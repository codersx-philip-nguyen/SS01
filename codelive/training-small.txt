1 The story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired .
1 There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
1 On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
3 Shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material
4 The film is bright and flashy in all the right ways .
3 If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .
4 The AAA of action , XXX is a blast of adrenalin , rated EEE for excitement .
0 What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
4 A well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .
3 An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .
2 Although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five Filipino-Americans and their frantic efforts to find love .
0 Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
4 Brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as Bond in Die Another Day .
2 Goes a long way on hedonistic gusto .
